# discrete-ebm-flow

This repo contains three different method
- Discrete Flow Model using conditional distribution modelling with known data (in the `punidb` folder)
- Discrete Flow Model using rate matrix modelling with known data (in the `runidb` folder)
- Discrete Flow Model using rate matrix modelling with known energy without data (in the `ebm_runidb` folder)
- Discrete Energy Discrepancy (in the `ed_ebm` folder)

To understand the training loss, you can refer to the Appendix F.2. in the discrete flow matching paper.

see `run.sh` to run the code with given command lines for different settings.
